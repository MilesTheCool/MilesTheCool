# About Me

My name is Miles Rasmussen (He/Him). I am a college freshman, and am studying for my Bachelor's in computer science.
For a long time, playing video games was my favorite past time. I loved open world games, like Fallout and Skyrim, 
stategy games like Civilization, and challenging games like the Dark Souls series. So when I first learned what
programming was, I was certain that I wanted to make a game. 

I tought myself Python through free online sources, and used the Pygame libary to make a few simple games. 
I started with Alien Invasion, I made a simple 2D platformer, and even a 3D FPS based on raytracing in the 
style of the old Doom games. Unfortunatly, most of these projects have been lost before I thought to upload them
here. 

While I became familiar with pygame, I was learning C++ and how to make basic programs for use in the terminal. 
Now, I am working on using C++ for more projects, including how to work with OpenGL to make visual programs.
While I do want to make a game or two with this, I actually plan on creating more useful projects, such as a 
text editor or pdf viewer.
